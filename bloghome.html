				<h2>House of Leaves: An Overview</h2>
				<h5>After recently reading HoL, I had some thoughts I thought I'd share.</h5>
				<p>While Danielewski himself classifies House of Leaves as a horror story, I can't help but think that the core of it all might just be love.
					At least in the Navidson Record. The story of Johnny Truant that we see through the footnotes not only provides a lovely counter-vibe to
					Zampano's lengthy (and often tiresome) analysis of the so-called documentary, but gives us a riveting secondary (though I hesitate to 
					call it such) story to follow.</p>

							Sure, the Navidson Record shows us the bond between Navidson and Karen, but I think it's disingenuous to call House of Leaves 'a love story'.

					<h2>Crochet Patterns?</h2>
					<h5>Just looking for some suggestions.</h5>
					<p>It's been a while. Nothing interesting to post about, but I do have a long weekend coming up so
					I was hoping to get some crocheting done. If anyone has any suggestions for free patterns, please
					put them in the comments! I usually stick to amigurumi and try to stay away from sewing, so keep that
					in mind? Thanks.</p>

							Jade from Sweet Softies has a great octopus amigurumi on her blog! No sew, and I think you can 
							knock one out in a few hours tops.
